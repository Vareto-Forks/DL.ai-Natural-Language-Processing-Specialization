# Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models

<br>

This is the third course in the Natural Language Processing Specialization.

## Week 1: Sentiment with Neural Nets
Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets

## Week 2: Language Generation Models
Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model

## Week 3: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Train a recurrent neural network to perform NER using LSTMs with linear layers

## Week 4: Siamese Networks
Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning
