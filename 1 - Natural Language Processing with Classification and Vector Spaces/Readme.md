# Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

<br>

This is the first course of the Natural Language Processing Specialization.

## Week 1: Logistic Regression for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
Use a simple method to classify positive or negative sentiment in tweets

## Week 2: Na√Øve Bayes for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
Use a more advanced model for sentiment analysis

## Week 3: Vector Space Models
Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships

## Week 4: Word Embeddings and Locality Sensitive Hashing for Machine Translation
Write a simple English-to-French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbors search
